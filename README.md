# DC & Marvel: Can we really compare them?

The data typically originates from Marvel Wikia and DC Wikia. Distinctive characters were scraped on August 24. Appearance tallies were scraped on September 2. The month and year of the vital issue each character showed up in was extracted on October 6. 

The data are split into two files, for DC and Marvel, respectively: dc-wikia-data.csv and marvel-wikia-data.csv.

We are already familiar with the fact that how much popularity the Comic Books are getting these days. Marvel and DC have a huge fan base in all the countries around the world. The recent releases prove that super hero genre in movies is never going to fade, instead the Box office collection of these movies are breaking some of the oldest records. Avengers Infinity Wars broke the record of Star Wars which is considered to be the most popular movie in The United States of America. It is not all movies like Black Panther(Marvel) coming with a full cast of Black Americans now stand in the Top 10 most earning movies till date around the world, Wonder Woman(DC), a movie with a female lead did wonders in the Box Office. All the release from Marvel and DC have been loved by the audiences world wide and accepted whole heartedly. Since, the popularity of Marvel and DC is a concern related to World Entertainment. I am very curious to investigate the data and find some interesting results.

This aim of he project is get insight about the dataset.<br>
